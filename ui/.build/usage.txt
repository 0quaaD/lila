Usage:
  ui/build <options>  # multiple short options can be preceded by a single dash

Options:
  -h, --help          show this help and exit
  -w, --watch         build and watch for changes
  -c, --clean         clean all build artifacts and build fresh
  -p, --prod          build minified assets (prod builds)
  -n, --no-install    don't run pnpm install
  -d, --debug         build assets with site.debug = true
  -t, --test          typecheck sources in ./tests/**. warning - this enables skipLibCheck for dependencies
  -l, --log=<url>     monkey patch console log functions in javascript manifest to POST log messages to
                      <url> or localhost:8666 (default). if used with --watch, the ui/build process
                      will listen for http on 8666 and display received json as 'web' in build logs
  --update            update ui/.build/node_modules with pnpm install
  --no-color          don't use color in logs
  --no-time           don't log the time
  --no-context        don't log the context

Exclusive Options:    (any of these will disable other functions)
  --clean-exit        clean all build artifacts and exit
  --tsc               run tsc on {package}/tsconfig.json and dependencies
  --sass              run sass on {package}/css/build/*.scss and dependencies
  --esbuild           run esbuild (given in {package}/package.json/lichess/bundles array)
  --sync              run sync copies (given in {package}/package.json/lichess/sync objects)
  --i18n              build @types/lichess/i18n.d.ts and translation/js files

Recommended:
  ui/build -cdw       # clean, build debug, and watch for changes with clean rebuilds

Other Examples:
  ./build -np         # no pnpm install, build minified
  ./build --tsc -w    # watch mode but type checking only
  ./build -dwl=/x     # build debug, watch. patch console methods in emitted js to POST log statements
                        to ${location.origin}/x. ui/build watch process displays messages received
                        via http/s on this endpoint as 'web' in build logs
